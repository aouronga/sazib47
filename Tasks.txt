Round 1: Technical Tasks
Angular Part:
Create an angular module that meets the following requirements:
1) It must be able to pass data between route controllers. Like for example have an input
field in one route where its contents will be displayed in the next route. Please do not
use $rootScope.
2) Has a filter that takes the following array and arranges its items by "name" and orders
them -
[
{id: 3, name: ‘rahaman’},
{id: 1, name: ‘bashar’},
{id: 2, name: ‘anwar’},
]
3) Has a directive that is ​ dependent of ​ ngModel , restricts the input to numbers only for key
press.
4) Uses ui-route ​ to have multiple ​ ui-views in the page. Each view should load a content
based on the route.
Django and DRF Part:
Create a Django and DRF application that will expose the following API endpoints.
1) /api/v1/contact/ - A user will be able to get a list of all the contacts and will be able to
create a new contact using this endpoint.
2) /api/v1/contact/<id>/ - A user will be able to update and delete a contact using this
endpoint.Other Requirements:
